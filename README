Kestrel: An XMPP-based Many-Task Computing Framework
====================================================

Description:
------------
Kestrel is a job scheduler and dispatcher for distributed computing systems, particularly Virtual Organization Clusters, and uses XMPP_ for monitoring the state of all compute elements in the cluster and dispatching tasks.

Dependencies:

Kestrel depends on the 1.0 release (presently the develop branch) of the SleekXMPP_ library, but there currently is no SleekXMPP package on PyPI_. Download and install a copy from GitHub_ before installing ``kestrel``.

Development:
------------
Main development is now being done at http://github.com/legastero/Kestrel.
